In this architecture, we have applied Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) with different built in and custom CNNs to properly classify our leukemia dataset.The dataset is available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehradaria/leukemia
Different CNNs like DesnNet101, ResNet50, EfficientNetB6 etc have been applied with CBAM. Finally after the Grad-CAM analysis we can better understand the regions of interests in our feature maps. We have also published our findings through a paper named 
"Attention Mechanism-enhanced Deep CNN Architecture for Precise Multi-Class Leukemia Classification".
